# Resources
You should fill in this section with the resources that you used to develop your code.  You don't need to include the teaching staff or the textbook, but you should list anyone you worked with, and any online or paper resources you used.

# Overview
The problem is pretty simple, so there's not much to say here.  The primary challenge will be wading through the compiler spew if you make a mistake.

# Submission
Your code should be pushed to your classwork 10 repository, and then you should submit to Gradescope from there.  You will not be able to upload files directly.

# Problem

Upgrade your `Array` class to hold a 1D array of any class, using a template.  All of the operations you've written so far should work on objects of any time.
